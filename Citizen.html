    <h2> Components of Being a Good Citizen </h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Citizenship- the quality of being a being a good person.</ul>
      <li> Honesty- Honesty is a neccesary part of being a citizen because if you are honest, even when you make a mistake you
    are honest about what you did and will likely be punished less than if you lied. </li>
      <li> Compassion- Compassion is a necessary characteristic for being a good citizen because compassion shows not only <!DOCTYPE html>
      you care about your peers, but you strive to help them through their tough times when you could just sit back and watch.
    </li>
      <li> Respect- Having respect is required if you want to be a good citizen because when
      someone is talking to you, they would not say what they had to say unless it was important, so being respectful and listening
    to what they have to say is showing you are being a good citizen. </li>
      <li> Responsibility- Being responsible is a key part of being a good citizen
      because when you are responsible, you make good decisions and think things through and what will happen as a result, which will
    help them stay out of trouble which is being a good citizen. </li>
      <li> Courage- Courage is a very important part of being a good citizen. Courage is important because if you have courage, you are not afraid of change, also
    you are not afraid of what other people think of you, you care about doing what is right and doing things that everyone is scared to do. </li>
      <li> Selfless- Selflessness is a key part of being a citizen because like compashion and courage, you
          give up yourself, and go out of your way to help another person which is a key quality to being a good citizen.</li>
      <li> The most recent act of powerful citizenship I have done is stopping someone from being bullied. I was at camp for basketball and we were playing a game.
        One of the kids was having a bad game and one of our teamates was yelling at him. I told him during the game just to calm down and play but he kept doing it.
        After the game, the kid was feeling really down and looked like he was about to cry. I sat next to him and started talking to him about the game and how well
        he did. I tried to tell him he did well in the game and that even if he had not done his best this game, he can only do better next game. He seemed to be feeling
        better and the next game he had a really good game and lead our team to victory. After the game, he had a smile on his face the whole time and even the kid who
        was yelling at him was praising how good he was.</li>
