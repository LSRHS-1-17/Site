    <h1>Lost</h1>
  <p> Hello! You must be (insert name here)! You're in a pretty tough situation here. You and your friend were hanging out and decided to go and spend the night outdoors.
    You had a long day at school so you decide to take a nap. Your friend thinks it would be funny to drag you out of the car and leave you with some supplies. Your friend drives off
    and leaves you on the side of the road. </p>
